I am currently working on building an ios app to monitor the moisture level in the soil of house plants and gardens.  The app is designed to measure the moisture and trigger a pump to water the plants.  This is done using a Raspberry Pi running a web application in combination with an Arduino which reads the moisture and triggers the pump when a call is made from the app.
