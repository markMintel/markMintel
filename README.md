# Hi there 

I am a data engineer and software developer with a background in chemical engineering.  I love to create and explore new tools to evolve my skills and push towards innovative solutions to the complex problems in our world.


## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

My most recent project was building an ios app that connect to my GCP-hosted API to monitor the moisture level in the soil of house plants and gardens.  The app is designed to measure the moisture and trigger a pump to water the plants.  This is done using a Raspberry Pi in combination with an Arduino which reads the moisture and triggers the pump when a call is made from the app.  The app supports multiple users, tracks moisture level trends, as well as multiple plant integration.  The next steps will be integrating an LLM into the UI to give insights into your plants and well as suggestions on how to keep them healthy. The application was built in python and has a fully functioning CI/CD pipeline.
